**Operation Vigilant Adventure**

We are generating kilobytes random data at a time by analyzing gigabytes or even terabytes of random data. The name vigilant adventure means that we are being vigilant for random data that can be valuable. It has applications in data science, music, technology, and more. My CPU is capable of generating such data a few times a week.

*What's the point of this?*

This operation is designed to benefit research for various fields. It is not optimal for security because this data is publicly available and lower quality random numbers will also suffice most of the time.
