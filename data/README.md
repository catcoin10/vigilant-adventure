These are samples of random data. This data is made by selecting 8,192 byte random files *with an entropy of 7.987 bits per byte or more*. This is done to make data that is more statistically random than average random data.

To check how random a piece of data is, see the tool *ent* for Linux. The data is encoded in hexadecimal, and everything except for the timestamp at the first line contains hex data with enters/newlines.
